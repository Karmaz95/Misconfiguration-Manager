_Figure 1 - Client Push Installation Properties_

In SCCM versions prior to 2207, there exists a bug such that without this setting enabled, the connection will fallback to NTLM regardless of the setting. Microsoft patched this bug in [KB15599094](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/hotfix/2207/15599094). This patch is applied by default to new site installations of version 2207+.

This patch only applies to versions 2103+. If the installed version is older, Microsoft recommends updating to a current version.
